// //You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is available. Think of three more guests 
// to invite to dinner.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 15. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing 
// people that you found a bigger dinner table.
// • Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.
// • Add one new guest to the middle of your array.
// • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
// • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list




//here is the previous guest list .
let guestlist1:string[] = ['Hamna' ,`kashaf`, `Alisha`, `sania`, `Hira`,(`Noor`)];
 
// let's declare the print statement with the help of for loop method //
for ( let i =0; i <guestlist1.length; i ++){ console.log(`${guestlist1} i have found a bigger table , let's invite some more.`);
